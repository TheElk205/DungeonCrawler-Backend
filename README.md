# DungeonCrawler-Backend
This is the backend for the Dungeon crawler game. At first, it will only provide a leaderboard. Later it will support multi player. Why not firebase or simething similar? Because i want to learn, not develop stuff. I am prone to postgres and deployment, so my only new part is the RUST backend server.
